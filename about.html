{% include header-section.html word1="Raquel" word2="Alves" word3="Araujo" word4="Ferreira" paragraph="Growing up you would always see me drawing or doodling, whether it was in a notebook, on my arms or walls. I developed a love for designs, drawings and patterns fairly early in life and after taking an arts and crafts class when I lived in Mexico, really reenforced my love for graphic design." paragraph2="I had the opportunity to have travelled the world and I had the great pleasure of being inspired by great artists like Tarsila do Amaral, Frida Khalo, Vik Muniz, Romero Britto, Saul Bass, Paul Rand, Paula Scher, to name a few. I always feel inspired by creativity and I hope that my work is able to someday, inspire kids to join the life of arts like I was when I was younger."%}
