    paragraph="Growing up you would always see me drawing or doodling, whether it was in a notebook, on my arms or walls. I developed a love for designs, drawings and patterns fairly early in life and after taking an arts and crafts class when I lived in Mexico, really reenforced my love for graphic design"
    paragraph2="I had the opportunity to have travelled the world and the great pleasure of being inspired by great artists like Tarsila do Amaral, Frida Khalo, Vik Muniz, Romero Britto, Saul Bass, Paul Rand, Paula Scher, to name a few"
    paragraph3="I hope that my work is able to ispire, not only just kids, but anyone to join the life of arts and like I was when I was younger"
